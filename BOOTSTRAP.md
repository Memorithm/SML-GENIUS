# SML-GENIUS bootstrap

This file is the durable re-entry point for continuing the SML-GENIUS research programme from the current repository state. Read it together with `README.md`, `docs/ROADMAP.md`, the latest merged pull requests, and the executable contracts in `sml-core`.

## Current architectural direction

SML is an independent, predominantly Boolean / low-bit autoregressive architecture. It is not defined by reference to Transformer internals. Its native mechanisms include direct routing, Mixture-of-Routers / sparse expert selection, bounded associative memory, recurrent depth, Elastic Weights, and Boolean-integral learning experiments.

The new semantic representation programme is **Semantic Boolean Geometry (SBG)**.

SBG treats meaning as a context-sensitive Boolean state rather than as a fixed real-valued embedding.

The reference semantic state is:

```text
SemanticState = (V, M, A, R)

V = Semantic Value Field
M = Context Meaning Mask
A = Ambiguity Field
R = Routing Field
```

The initial experimental width is 16,384 bits per field. Four fields therefore represent 65,536 logical bits = 8,192 packed payload bytes before container metadata. The width is a benchmark hypothesis, not a frozen architectural constant.

Core invariants:

- packed machine-word representation, initially `u64`;
- no `f32`/`f64` dependency in the SBG core;
- fail-closed dimensional/padding validation;
- allocation-free in-place Boolean primitives after construction;
- XOR/XNOR/AND/OR/NOT/POPCOUNT as primary operations;
- context-dependent masked similarity rather than one immutable semantic metric;
- ambiguity preserved explicitly instead of forcing premature single-sense collapse;
- compositional binding/bundling/permutation;
- routing field feeds native MOR selection;
- recurrent depth rewrites semantic state until a declared stability criterion;
- meaning/routing masks may drive Elastic Weight page activation;
- learning work must test discrete Boolean evidence/credit mechanisms rather than assume gradient descent is required.

## Versioning reconciliation

The repository already uses `SML-0.7` for Elastic Weights and has merged later `SML-0.8.x` MOR / Boolean-integral work. The earlier conversational SBG roadmap used overlapping SML-0.x labels.

Do **not** reuse those occupied SML labels.

Implementation uses the independent **SBG-0.x** slice namespace while preserving the same roadmap content.

## Relationship to the earlier requested SML labels

The roadmap content originally described as SML-0.7 through SML-0.20 maps in order to SBG-0.1 through SBG-0.14. This rename exists solely to avoid colliding with already merged repository milestones.

## Current work and durable checkpoints

Reference-semantic SBG-0.1 through SBG-0.11 slices are merged. SBG-0.12 ARM64 kernel qualification merged through PRs #53-55; frozen evidence is in `docs/SBG-0.12-ARM64-QUALIFICATION.md`. Its timing ratio compares against a bit-by-bit oracle, not a complete model or all alternative packed kernels.

SML-1.3 controlled routing/keyed-memory ablations merged through PR #52. Learned routing does not beat fixed routing on that reference panel. SML-1.4 unary recall/copy projections merged through PR #56; marker activation and payload/control-flow semantics remain fixed and require separate learning experiments.

SBG-0.13a byte format merged through PR #57 as `786c0d549c78aae550bff14157d95ed472af2e8d`.

Latest implementation slice: **SBG-0.13b**, PR #60, branch `research/sbg-0.13b-mapped-runtime`. Check the live PR status before resuming: once merged, branch from current `main` rather than reusing this slice branch.

Implementation surfaces:

```text
crates/sml-core/src/semantic/store_format.rs
crates/sml-store/src/lib.rs
crates/sml-store/tests/mapped_store.rs
docs/SBG-0.13b-MAPPED-RUNTIME.md
scripts/check-lockfile.sh
```

Definition of done for SBG-0.13b:

1. actual read-only Linux file mapping, with no full-file heap fallback;
2. one-time descriptor/index validation and lazy per-record CRC32C/V/M/A/R decoding;
3. explicit virtual-file, record-count and decoded-payload limits;
4. canonical layout checks reject zero or insufficient record strides before decoding;
5. shared-lock ownership survives for the mapping lifetime, with explicit immutable-inode assumptions;
6. tests cover actual mapping, corruption before mapping, truncation, budgets, reopen, concurrent readers, exclusive-writer rejection and atomic replacement;
7. dependency versions are frozen in a tracked Cargo.lock;
8. format/check/clippy/workspace tests, store evidence and existing CLI smoke gates all pass on the latest PR head before merge.

The workspace retains `forbid(unsafe_code)` and the core retains no external dependencies. OS mapping uses pinned mmap-guard, which encapsulates unsafe code in its dependencies. This is not a safety proof against arbitrary external mutation: mapped inodes must never be modified/truncated while in use. Locks are cooperative; CRC32C is not authentication. Reader counters are logical payload/mapping counters, not RSS, page-cache or actual I/O measurements.

Next implementation gates:

- **SBG-0.13c**: cold/warm latency, RSS/page faults and traffic on growing stores; streamed publication and stronger immutable/index-integrity contracts. Do not mark the broad store/resource gate complete from small fixtures alone.
- **SBG-0.14**: connect mapped lookup to native SBG/MOR/Elastic/expert/memory/recurrent execution with end-to-end evidence.
- **SML-1 follow-up**: learned marker/control, wider matched ablations, fixed-versus-adaptive depth. Freeze SML-0/SML-1 protocols before SML-2.
- **Elastic actuation**: native SML physical page materialization and VERIFY/ROLLBACK; other Memorithm repositories are research/qualification partners, not mandatory inference dependencies.

## Scientific boundary

SBG is currently an architectural hypothesis plus executable reference semantics. No claim is made yet that it matches or exceeds continuous language embeddings, that 16,384 bits is optimal, that Boolean-only training scales to 25B, or that SBG improves language-model quality. Those are experimental questions gated by the roadmap above.

## BANC v888 Connectomic Structural Prior track

The V888-only connectomic programme is now a parallel SML research track under the **CSP** namespace so it does not collide with SML or SBG milestones. Its durable execution plan is [`docs/V888_CONNECTOME_BOOTSTRAP.md`](docs/V888_CONNECTOME_BOOTSTRAP.md).

CSP treats BANC v888 as an external source of structural priors, not as an inference-time dependency and not as a biological model to reproduce. The required progression is topology fingerprint -> matched structural controls -> low-bit sparse recurrence -> event-driven active compute -> bounded-memory/SBG/MOR integration -> trainable/Forge-selected topology -> independent TDI evaluation. No CSP result may enter SML-2 merely because it uses V888; it must beat the strongest declared matched controls under the evidence gate in the CSP roadmap.
